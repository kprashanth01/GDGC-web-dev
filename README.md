E-Commerce Website:
This project showcases a clean and responsive layout for product cards, including an "Add to Cart" button that appears centered at the bottom of each card. The design uses modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox for aligning elements and adding interactive hover effects. It uses JavaScript to add functionality to "Add to Cart". 
Attached is the demo video to understand the functionality of application.
